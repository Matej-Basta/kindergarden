        <h2>mission</h2>
        <p>
          We believe children should stay children as long as they need and the
          fact that they enter 1st grade should not end their childhood. We
          intertwine playing and learning at such an early age and encourage our
          students to enjoy learning.

        <h2>about us</h2>
        <p>
          We began as a visionary venture in 1998 when Dr. Gabriel and Alish
          Black, world-class academics in the field of economics, endeavored to
          find a way to prepare students for college and the real world better
          than schools did at the time. They quickly found that the best way to
          make students thrive was simple: challenge them. After opening their
          first school in 1998, the Blocks discovered that students, when given
          a well-crafted curriculum and teachers who truly cared about teaching
          it, were able to learn at exceedingly high levels, meeting and
          surpassing the best students in the world. What began as a single
          campus has grown to become a unique, high-achieving, and unprecedented
          network of schools.
